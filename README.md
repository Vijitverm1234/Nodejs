## Description

> Node.js is a powerful JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, enabling developers to build scalable network applications with ease. It uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it efficient and suitable for data-intensive real-time applications. This project showcases the capabilities of Node.js in developing server-side applications, APIs, and microservices.

### Key Features

- **Asynchronous and Event-Driven**: Utilizes non-blocking I/O to handle multiple connections concurrently without the overhead of thread management.
- **Single Programming Language**: Allows developers to use JavaScript for both client-side and server-side development, streamlining the development process.
- **NPM (Node Package Manager)**: Provides access to a vast ecosystem of libraries and modules, facilitating rapid development and code reuse.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works seamlessly across different operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **Rich Community Support**: A large and active community provides extensive resources, tutorials, and libraries to aid development.
